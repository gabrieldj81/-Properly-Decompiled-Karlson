# (Properly)Decompiled-Karlson
Pls Note I may have messed with some of the code to keep your editor from being bambarded with errors

Compared to the original decompiled Karlson, I fully decompiled Karlson with full Scripts, Materials, Models, Animations,
Scenes, Sounds, Prefabs, and Shaders.
Now you can easily make karlson mods! No Need To edit the direct source code!
As an added bonus you bassically have a Karlson Map editor.
